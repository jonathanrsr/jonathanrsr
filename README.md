# About Me - Jonathan Ryser

Hey there! 👋 I'm Jonathan Ryser, a 25-year-old from Fribourg, Switzerland. I have a diverse background spanning both IT and chemical engineering.

## Education

🎓 Currently, I'm pursuing my master's degree in Chemical Engineering at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/), where I'm delving into advanced topics in chemical engineering and honing my skills in problem-solving and research.

🔬 I also hold a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the [Haute Ecole d'Ingénierie et d'Architecture de Fribourg (HEIA-FR)](https://www.heia-fr.ch/), where I gained a strong foundation in fundamental principles and practical applications in the field.

💻 Additionally, I have a professional qualification with a CFC (Certificat Fédéral de Capacité) in IT, which adds a technical dimension to my skill set and allows me to approach problems from both engineering and computational perspectives.

## Interests

🧪 I'm passionate about the intersection of chemistry and technology, especially in areas like process optimization, sustainable engineering, and materials science.

🖥️ With a background in IT, I have a keen interest in leveraging programming and computational tools to tackle complex challenges in chemical engineering, from data analysis to simulation.

🌱 Outside of academics and technology, I enjoy exploring nature, hiking in the Swiss Alps, and discovering new cultures through travel.
